# RFM-Analysis-and-Customer-Segmentation
Complete customer purchasing behaviour analysis was done on a retail dataset. Initially data cleaning and EDA was done. Each customer was grouped to a cohort to analyze their retention rate. RFM model was created based on their receny, frequency and monetary values. RFM scores were given to each customer and each customer was grouped to 4 clusters as high value, medium value based on their RFM scores. Finally customer segmentation was done using K means clustering algorithm. 5 clusters were selected using elbow method and customers were grouped to one of the clusters. Additionally charts were made in tableau to visualize our results better.
